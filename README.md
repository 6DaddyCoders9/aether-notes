## \#\#  Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the AetherNotes application running locally on your machine.

### **Prerequisites**

  * **Docker** and **Docker Compose:** Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and running.
  * **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/6DaddyCoders9/aether-notes.git
cd aethernotes
```

### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**

The project uses a `.env` file to manage all necessary API keys and secrets.

  * Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  * Now, open the newly created `.env` file and fill in your unique credentials for:
      * Mailgun (for OTP emails)
      * Google OAuth 2.0 (for Google login)

### **3. Build and Run the Application**

With Docker, the entire application stack (frontend, backend, and database) can be launched with a single command.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

1.  Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend services.
2.  Start the containers for all services.
3.  Set up a network for the containers to communicate.

The application is now running\!
